# Admission_prediction
# Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating admission probabilities for prospective graduate students applying to different university classes. The model is implemented using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and incorporates a diverse set of input features, including GRE scores, TOEFL scores, institutional class rankings, ratings for subjective components (statements of purpose, letters of recommendation), and CGPA.

# Implementation
To run the code, follow these steps:

Navigate to the Admission_Predict_main directory: cd ./Admission_Predict_main

Run the Python application: python app.py
# Dependencies
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, flask
# Usage
Once the application is running, access the provided URL to interact with the predictive model. Users can input their academic credentials and receive personalized admission probability estimates for different university classes.
